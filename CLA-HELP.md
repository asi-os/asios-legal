## 🛠️ How to Sign

1. Open a Pull Request.  
2. The CLA Assistant bot will prompt you.  
3. Click **Sign the CLA**, authenticate, and accept.

> **If signing on behalf of a company**, ensure your organization has executed the CCLA first. Contact **legal@karlex.ai** if needed.

You only sign once—future PRs will auto-verify.

## 🧠 Quick Notes

- All contributions require a one-time CLA signature.  
- Each commit also needs a DCO sign-off:  
  ```bash
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
  ```  
- The CLA Assistant automates checks—PRs aren’t blocked once signed.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

- **Legal clarity:** Protects you and the project by ensuring clear rights and attribution.  
- **Convenience:** One-click, one-time process.  
- **Efficiency:** Automated verification—no manual gating.
